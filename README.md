# YouTube Clean Results

This is a Chromium extension that allows you to remove Shorts and Related Results from YouTube Search.

Mainly created this out of frustration \*\_\* Personally I find all the recommended results (related, shorts, people also watched etc.) a distraction and a waste of my time, I prefer to see only the results to my queries.

And thus, YouTube Clean Results plugin :)

You can find it in the [extensions store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/youtube-clean-results-plu/bfaigaidngndgbmdkbgmcgekpndhmbel).

### Running locally

-   Create build by running `npm run build`

-   In your Chromium browser (Chrome, Brave etc.), go to Manage Extensions and enable "Developer Mode"

-   Select "Load unpacked" and point it to the build folder `dist/`
